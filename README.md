This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (swdish_insurance_linear_regression.ipynb) that demonstrates linear regression analysis on the Auto Insurance in Sweden dataset. The notebook explores the relationship between the number of claims and total payment for car insurance in Sweden.

Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the "Auto Insurance in Sweden" dataset, which is available in the insurance.txt file within the repository. This dataset contains two columns: the number of claims and the total payment for each observation.
